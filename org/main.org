#+TITLE: Mehmet Tekman

Hi everyone. This is a little static site about me and my interests.

I've tried to keep the fanciness to a minimum, but there are small surprises here and there. This is by far not everything, but I've included repos of mine that I either dedicated a lot of time to, or am proud in some small way.
